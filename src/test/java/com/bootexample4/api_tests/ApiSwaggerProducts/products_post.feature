 # Gherkin Audit: Testing product API

## Validation and Syntax
1. **Consistent indentation:** Find a consistent way to represent and organize the Gherkin structure across all levels of hierarchy to preserve the logical organization and layout of the Gherkin structure. For instance, the use of **four spaces indentation** could be adopted.
2. **Keyword alignment:** Validate that every step initiates with a keyword ('Given', 'When', 'Then', 'And', 'But') and is immediately succeeded by a solitary space.
3. **Precision title and description alignment:** Ensure that there is no trailing space or misalignment between the scenario title and its respective step description.
4. **Scenario differentiation:** Accurately delineate each scenario with either 'Scenario:' or 'Scenario Outline:' as per the structure and requirements.
5. **Scene and outline placeholder usage:** Reconfirm the usage, spelling, and consistency of scene and outline placeholders.
6. **Unmatched characters:** Keep an eye out for any unmatched quotation marks or parentheses that could potentially harm test execution.

## Error Resolution
1. **Scenario Outline:** For scenarios that incorporate examples, they should begin with "Scenario Outline". For those that do not include examples, simply start with "Scenario". This is in line with Gherkin standard guidelines.
2. **Scenario flow restructuring:** Independently review and reorganize scenario workflows to ensure that each scenario follows a clear, logical path via distinct and separate steps. Split scenarios with multiple activities or steps into distinct scenarios or step definitions to improve traceability and maintainability. 
3. **Unused keywords:** Avoid using the "anyof" keyword. Instead, consider using alternative approaches to achieving the same result.

## Best Practices
1. **Industry standards:** Keep up to date with current industry norms and best practices for Karate in Java tests. Update outdated practices without disrupting the underlying scenario logic. 
2. **Positive Result Accuracy:** Keep step descriptions lucid, unambiguous, and easy to comprehend to reduce the likelihood of incorrect interpretation.
