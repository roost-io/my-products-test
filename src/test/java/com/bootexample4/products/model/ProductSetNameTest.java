Scenario 1: Set A Valid Name

Details:  
  TestName: testSetNameToValidName
  Description: This test is meant to check if a valid name can be successfully set.
Execution:
   Arrange: A valid String object as a name. 
   Act: Invoke the setName method with the valid string.
   Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the name is set correctly.
Validation: 
   The assertion aims to verify that the valid name has been accepted and stored. The test validates the core functionality of the setName method.
   
Scenario 2: Set Empty Name

Details:  
  TestName: testSetNameToEmptyString
  Description: This test checks the behavior of setName when provided an empty string.
Execution:
   Arrange: An empty String object. 
   Act: Invoke the setName method with an empty string.
   Assert: Verify if the name value is empty.
Validation: 
   This confirms that the setName method does not impose any restrictions on setting fields to an empty string. Any potential issues will depend on how this name value is later used in the application.
   
Scenario 3: Set Name As Null

Details:  
  TestName: testSetNameToNull
  Description: This test checks the behavior when the setName method is given a null reference.
Execution:
   Arrange: A null reference. 
   Act: Invoke the setName method with null.
   Assert: Verify if the name value is null.
Validation: 
   It's important to know how the method will behave when fed null values. In this case, it's expected to set the name value to null.
   
Scenario 4: Set Name As Special Characters

Details:  
  TestName: testSetNameWithSpecialCharacters
  Description: This test checks if the setName method can handle strings which contain special characters.
Execution:
   Arrange: A string object containing special characters. 
   Act: Invoke the setName method with the special characters string.
   Assert: Verify if the name value is expected special characters string.
Validation: 
   By following this scenario, we're checking whether setName method can handle name strings with special characters. This will be useful to know when validating user input.
