Scenario 1: Test to check if getPrice method returns correct price
Details:  
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsCorrectPrice.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns the correct price that was previously set for the Product. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Product object and use the setPrice method to set a specific price. 
    Act: Invoke the getPrice method on the Product object. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned price against the price that was set.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method accurately returns the price that was set for the Product. The expected result is the same price that was set as this would confirm that the getPrice method is functioning correctly. This test is significant as it ensures that the correct price is returned, which is crucial for accurate billing and pricing calculations.

Scenario 2: Test to check if getPrice method returns default price when no price is set
Details:  
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsDefaultWhenNotSet.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns a default price (which should be 0.0) when no price has been set for the Product. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Product object without setting a price. 
    Act: Invoke the getPrice method on the Product object. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned price against the default price (0.0).
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method accurately returns the default price when no price has been set for the Product. The expected result is 0.0 as this would confirm that the getPrice method is returning the default price correctly. This test is significant as it ensures that a Product without a set price doesn't lead to erroneous pricing calculations.

Scenario 3: Test to check if getPrice method returns updated price after price change
Details:  
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsUpdatedPriceAfterChange.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns the updated price after the price of the Product has been changed. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Product object and set a specific price. Then, change the price to a different value. 
    Act: Invoke the getPrice method on the Product object. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned price against the updated price.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method accurately returns the updated price after a price change. The expected result is the new price that was set as this would confirm that the getPrice method is reflecting price changes correctly. This test is significant as it ensures that price updates are accurately reflected when retrieved, which is important for maintaining accurate pricing information.
