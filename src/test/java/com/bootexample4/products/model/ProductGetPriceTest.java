================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: The getPrice() method might expose sensitive information through query strings in GET requests if it's used in a web application context. This could lead to information disclosure.
Solution: Ensure that sensitive data is not exposed in query strings. Consider using POST requests or secure methods of data transmission.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The getPrice() method is public, which means it can be accessed from any class in the application. If the price data is sensitive and should not be exposed to all classes, this could be a privacy violation.
Solution: Consider making the getPrice() method private or protected, or controlling access to it with appropriate permissions.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: If the price data is used in a context where it should not be exposed (such as logging or error messages), this could lead to information exposure.
Solution: Ensure that the price data is not exposed in inappropriate contexts. Use secure logging practices and do not include sensitive data in error messages.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if getPrice method returns correct price
Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsCorrectPrice.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns the correct price that was previously set for the Product.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Product object and use the setPrice method to set a specific price.
    Act: Invoke the getPrice method on the Product object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned price against the price that was set.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method accurately returns the price that was set for the Product. The expected result is the same price that was set as this would confirm that the getPrice method is functioning correctly. This test is significant as it ensures that the correct price is returned, which is crucial for accurate financial calculations and transactions.

Scenario 2: Test to check if getPrice method returns default price when no price is set
Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsDefaultWhenNotSet.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns a default price when no price has been set for the Product.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Product object without setting a price.
    Act: Invoke the getPrice method on the Product object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned price against the expected default price.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method returns a default price when no price has been set for the Product. The expected result is the default price as this would confirm that the getPrice method handles cases where no price has been set. This test is significant as it ensures that a default price is returned when necessary, preventing potential null or unexpected values.

Scenario 3: Test to check if getPrice method returns correct price after price update
Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsUpdatedPrice.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns the updated price after the price of the Product has been changed.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Product object and use the setPrice method to set a specific price. Then, update the price with a new value.
    Act: Invoke the getPrice method on the Product object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned price against the updated price.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method accurately returns the updated price. The expected result is the updated price as this would confirm that the getPrice method successfully reflects price changes. This test is significant as it ensures the correct price is returned even after updates, which is essential for maintaining accurate product information.
