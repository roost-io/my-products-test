================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Public Data within the Private Class
Issue: The getPrice() method allows public read access to the price field of the Product class. If the price data is sensitive or proprietary, exposing it in this manner may lead to unauthorized information disclosure.
Solution: Use tighter access control for class fields. Consider encapsulating the price field inside the class and provide public getter and setter methods which appropriately validate or sanitize the data.

Vulnerability: CWE-913: Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources
Issue: The current code class provides no method to manually manage the resources it creates or uses. Large objects, or if invoked frequently enough, could over time consume substantial system resources, which in turn, may slow down or crash the system.
Solution: Provide the class a proper way to manage resources properly. Consider using finalizers/try-with-resources blocks/try-finally blocks for resource cleanup.

================================================================================
Scenarios Based on the provided information:

Scenario 1: Test to Validate Return Type
Details:
  TestName: testReturnTypeOfGetPrice.
  Description: This test verifies the method's return type, which should be double in this case.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as no parameters are being passed to the method.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Assert that the class of the returned object is Double.
Validation:
  This test asserts the method's return type. Since getPrice is meant to return a price, which is a double value, we expect the test to verify this.

Scenario 2: Test to Validate Non-Negative Return
Details:
  TestName: testNonNegativeReturnFromGetPrice.
  Description: This test checks that the getPrice method does not return a negative value, which should never be the case for a price.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as no parameters are being passed to the method.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is greater than or equal to 0.
Validation:
  This test validates that the price returned by the getPrice method is a non-negative value. A price should never be a negative number, and hence, the test checks for this.

Scenario 3: Test Immutable Price
Details:
  TestName: testTheImmutabilityOfGetPrice.
  Description: This test examines the immutability of the getPrice method by invoking it twice and comparing the results.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as no parameters are being passed to the method.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method twice.
  Assert: Assert that the two returned prices are the same.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the price returned by the getPrice method does not change across multiple calls as price, being a field of an object, should remain constant unless explicitly changed.

Scenario 4: Test Null Object Scenario
Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceOnNullObject.
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the getPrice method when it is called on a null object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a null object.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method on the null object.
  Assert: Catch the NullPointerException that should be thrown.
Validation:
  This test validates that the method throws an appropriate exception when invoked on a null object. This ensures the robustness of the code against erroneous usage.
