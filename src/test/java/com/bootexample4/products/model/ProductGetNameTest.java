================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Issue: If user-provided data in your web application isn't properly sanitized before display, your application may be at risk of a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attack. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious script that will be executed by the user's browser.
Solution: Implement input validation, output encoding and proper error handling. You should avoid outputting raw user-provided data. Instead, use mechanisms that automatically enforce encoding, such as Java's ESAPI library or Jakarta's output tags.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
Issue: If user-provided data is used to build SQL queries without proper sanitization, your application may be subjected to an SQL injection attack. This can allow an attacker to manipulate your database, leading to data leaks, data alteration, or even data loss.
Solution: Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements for SQL queries and avoid building SQL queries through string concatenation. Libraries like Hibernate, Spring's JdbcTemplate or Java's PreparedStatement make it easy to use parameterized queries.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing getName Method in Normal Conditions
Details:
TestName: testGetNameInNormalConditions
Description: This test verifies that the getName method returns the correct name property of an instance when invoked.
Execution:
Arrange: An instance of the class is created and the name property is set with a known value (for example: "TestName").
Act: The getName method is invoked on the instance.
Assert: The returned value is compared against the known value set in the Arrange step.
Validation:
This test assures that the getName method correctly retrieves the name property from an instance. This is key for properly accessing object's internal state across different parts of the application.

Scenario 2: Testing getName Method for Default Value
Details:
TestName: testGetNameForDefaultValue
Description: This test checks getName method's behavior when the name property is not explicitly set. Since default value for Strings in Java is null, this method should return null.
Execution:
Arrange: An instance of the class is created without setting any value to the name property.
Act: The getName method is invoked on the instance.
Assert: The returned value is asserted to be null.
Validation:
This test ensures that the getName method correctly handles the case where the name property is not set and returns the default value. This prevents potential null pointer exceptions throughout the application.

Scenario 3: Testing getName Method with Empty Name Value
Details:
TestName: testGetNameWithEmptyValue
Description: This test is designed to check whether the getName method can handle an empty string value without causing any errors.
Execution:
Arrange: An instance of the class is created with the name property set to an empty string ("").
Act: The getName method is invoked.
Assert: The returned value is asserted to be an empty string.
Validation:
This test confirms that the getName method can manage empty string values, which is important for ensuring the method's robustness against a variety of input scenarios.

Please Note:
The code details for the Arrange section in each scenario should come from the setter methods or class constructors that were not provided in the test scenario instructions. These details would be critical to adequately set up each test scenario.
