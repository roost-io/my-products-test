================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: The getId() method might be used in HTTP GET requests, exposing potentially sensitive information in URLs.
Solution: Avoid using sensitive data in GET requests. Use HTTP POST requests instead.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: Exposing the internal id of a database record can potentially leak sensitive information about the underlying system, or be used in further attacks.
Solution: Consider using UUIDs or other non-sequential identifiers for exposed data.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: If this getId() method is part of debug code, it may expose sensitive information or functionality in production.
Solution: Ensure that debug code is properly separated from production code and that debug features are disabled in production environments.

Vulnerability: CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
Issue: If this getId() method is used in a context where it can be accessed without proper authentication, it could expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
Solution: Ensure that all critical functions require appropriate authentication.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if the getId() method returns the correct product Id

Details:
  TestName: testGetIdReturnsCorrectId
  Description: This test is designed to verify that the getId() method returns the correct Id of the product. The Id of the product is set using the setId() method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the Product class and set the product Id using the setId() method.
  Act: Invoke the getId() method on the product instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned Id matches the Id that was set.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getId() method correctly retrieves the Id of the product. This is crucial for correctly identifying and retrieving products from the database.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the getId() method returns null when the product Id is not set

Details:
  TestName: testGetIdReturnsNullWhenIdNotSet
  Description: This test is meant to check that the getId() method returns null when the product Id has not been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the Product class without setting the product Id.
  Act: Invoke the getId() method on the product instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned Id is null.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getId() method returns null when the product Id is not set. This is important to avoid potential Null Pointer Exceptions when retrieving product Ids.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the getId() method returns the correct Id after the product Id is updated

Details:
  TestName: testGetIdReturnsUpdatedId
  Description: This test is designed to verify that the getId() method returns the updated Id after the product Id is changed using the setId() method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the Product class and set the product Id. Then, update the product Id using the setId() method.
  Act: Invoke the getId() method on the product instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned Id matches the updated Id.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getId() method correctly retrieves the updated Id of the product. This is critical for ensuring that the correct and updated product Id is always retrieved.
