================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) or CWE-639
Issue: A potential issue exists where by manipulating the ID parameter, an attacker might be able to access other objects directly. This ID does not seem to be protected or hidden in any way, so there might be a risk of unauthorized data access.
Solution: Add authorization checks to ensure that the user accessing the object is the same user who owns it. Implement access controls, or consider using UUID instead of sequential integers for object's IDs to minimize the risk.

Vulnerability: Information Exposure Through Class/Object/Method/Variable Names or CWE-200
Issue: The class name, method name and variable names may reveal information concerning the logic, design, and implementation of the software that could be exploited. Although, in this example we only see the getId() method, consider this while analyzing entire class or method definitions.
Solution: Give obfuscated names for the methods, variables, classes, etc. in the production version of the product. Do not include sensitive name choices in the source code, instead provide generalized names.

Vulnerability: Sensitive data exposure or CWE-201
Issue: This getId() method may expose sensitive data (e.g., internal ID). If such ID is sequential and predictable (which is quite common), it opens opportunities for insecure direct object references (IDOR) attacks.
Solution: Minimize the use of revealing IDs publicly. If unavoidable, make sure the ID is random, not predictable or sequential. Be sure all ID references are mapped and validated for the authorized user.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing if getId Method Returns Correct Non-Null Identifier
  Details:
    TestName: testGetIdForNonNullIdentifier
    Description: This test aims to check if the getId method is accurately returning the correct identifier when that value is not null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate or mock an entity with a non-null identifier.
    Act: Invoke the getId method on the instantiated entity.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual identifier returned by the getId method to the expected identifier.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that the getId method can accurately return identifiers for entities. If valid, this indicates correct retrieval of the identifier, which plays an integral role in entity retrieval and manipulation in the application.

Scenario 2: Testing if getId Method Returns Null for Unset Identifier
  Details:
    TestName: testGetIdForNullIdentifier
    Description: This test aims to check if the getId method correctly returns null when the identifier for an entity is not set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate or mock an entity with no identifier set.
    Act: Invoke the getId method on the instantiated entity.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result of getId (which should be null) with the expected result (null).
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify the getId method's behavior in scenarios where the entity's identifier is null or unset. This handles an edge case where entities might not have identifiers properly set due to human or computational error.

Scenario 3: Testing getId Method Across Multiple Entities
  Details:
    TestName: testGetIdAcrossMultipleEntities
    Description: This test aims to verify the getId method returns unique identifiers across multiple entities. It also checks if the method consistently returns the correct identifier when invoked repeatedly on the same entity.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate or mock multiple entities with unique identifiers.
    Act: Invoke the getId method on each entity and also repeatedly for the same entity.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to validate that getId returns unique identifiers for distinct entities and that it consistently returns the same identifier on the same entity.
  Validation:
    The purpose of this test to ensure the consistency and uniqueness of identifiers when the getId method is used. These are critical properties for identifier since they are often used to distinguish between and retrieve specific entities in a collection.
