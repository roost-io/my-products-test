Scenario 1: Test getId method of a product
Details:
  TestName: getIdOfProduct.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getId method returns the expected ID number for a specific product.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a product object and set an ID for this object using the setId method, say, id = 10.
  Act: Invoke the getId method of the product object.
  Assert: Assert that the getId result is equal to 10.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getId method works as expected and it returns the ID number that is initially set for the product. The test is crucial because the product ID is a unique identifier for each product and we rely on it for different actions such as querying, updating or deleting a product from a database.

Scenario 2: Test Null Id
Details:
  TestName: getIdOfProductWithoutSettingId.
  Description: This test case checks the getId method when id is not set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a product object without setting an ID.
  Act: Invoke getId method on the product object.
  Assert: Assert that getId returns null.
Validation:
  The test aims to confirm that getId method should return null if an Id is not set for the product. This case can occur when a product is newly created and yet to save in the database and assigned an ID.

Scenario 3: Test getId for a list of Products
Details:
  TestName: getIdOfMultipleProducts.
  Description: The testing scenario checks if getId method works correctly when there is Not merely One But instead multiple products.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an array of product objects and set different IDs for each of them.
  Act: Invoke the getId method for each product object.
  Assert: Assert that getId maintains the unique IDs of each product and match them with what was set earlier.
Validation:
  The objective of these assertions is to ascertain that getId method works perfectly fine for multiple products. This is exceptionally important as in a real-world scenario, we are doing operations not only on one but multiple products most of the time.

Scenario 4: Test getId after changing the product Id
Details:
  TestName: getIdAfterUpdatingProduct.
  Description: The test scenario verifies if the getId method returns the correct value after the value of product ID is updated.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a product object and set an ID. Then alter the ID with a new value.
  Act: Invoke getId method of the product object.
  Assert: Assert that getId returns the updated value.
Validation:
  This Work is to verify that by applying methods like setId, we are able to modify the Id of a particular product and getId returns the new ID accurately. This would be significant when modifying a product's details in the database.
