Scenario 1: Test getId method for a valid product ID

Details:
  TestName: getValidProductId
  Description: This test verifies that the getId method returns the correct product ID when called on a valid Product instance.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new Product instance with a known ID value.
    Act: Call the getId method on the Product instance.
    Assert: Assert that the returned ID matches the expected value.
  Validation:
    The assertion ensures that the getId method correctly retrieves and returns the ID value of the Product instance. This test validates the basic functionality of the getId method and serves as a sanity check for the method's implementation.

Scenario 2: Test getId method for a new product instance

Details:
  TestName: getIdForNewProduct
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the getId method when called on a newly created Product instance with no ID assigned yet.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new Product instance without setting an ID value.
    Act: Call the getId method on the new Product instance.
    Assert: Assert that the returned ID is null.
  Validation:
    The assertion ensures that the getId method returns null when called on a Product instance that has not been persisted or assigned an ID value. This test validates the expected behavior of the method for a new, unpersisted Product instance.

Scenario 3: Test getId method for a product instance with null ID

Details:
  TestName: getIdForNullId
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the getId method when called on a Product instance with a null ID value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new Product instance and set the ID value to null.
    Act: Call the getId method on the Product instance.
    Assert: Assert that the returned ID is null.
  Validation:
    The assertion ensures that the getId method returns null when the Product instance has a null ID value. This test validates the expected behavior of the method when dealing with null ID values and helps ensure proper handling of null values.

Scenario 4: Test getId method concurrency

Details:
  TestName: getIdConcurrencyTest
  Description: This test verifies the thread-safety of the getId method when multiple threads attempt to retrieve the product ID concurrently.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new Product instance with a known ID value. Set up a collection of threads that will concurrently call the getId method.
    Act: Start the threads and wait for them to complete execution.
    Assert: Assert that all threads returned the expected ID value and that no exceptions were thrown.
  Validation:
    The assertion ensures that the getId method operates correctly and consistently when accessed concurrently by multiple threads. This test validates the thread-safety of the method and helps identify potential race conditions or synchronization issues.

Note: While generating test scenarios, I have only used the provided public methods, fields, and import statements. If any additional methods or fields are required, they should be explicitly provided in the entity or import statements.
