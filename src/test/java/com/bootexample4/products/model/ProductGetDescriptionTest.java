================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) or CWE-639
Issue: Currently the application does not perform any kind of validation to check if the user is authorised to view the object's description. This can lead to unwanted data exposure.
Solution: Implement an access control check or use a mapping that does not expose direct references to internal implementation objects.

Vulnerability: Injection Vulnerability or CWE-77
Issue: Description field can be a potential point of attack if the input is not properly sanitized before using in the application. An attacker can manipulate the description field with malicious code, leading to code injection attack.
Solution: Use proper input validation and sanitization process and use parameterized queries or prepared statements.

Vulnerability: Information Exposure Through Sent Data or CWE-201
Issue: The object's description might contain sensitive information that should not be exposed. Without proper checks, this can lead to information disclosure.
Solution: Limit the exposure of sensitive information. Implement a content filter or data anonymization process to safeguard sensitive contents in the description field.

Vulnerability: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or CWE-79
Issue: If the description content is rendered directly on a website without sanitization, it might be possible to inject malicious scripts and execute in the userâ€™s browser.
Solution: Escape potentially unsafe characters before rendering them in a browser. Use a safe API which avoids the use of the interpreter entirely or provides a parameterized interface or migrate to use DOM based XSS prevention techniques.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for Default Description State

Details:
  TestName: validateDefaultDescription.
  Description: The description field is not set explicitly, thus this test will validate that the default state of the description is null after the object is instantiated.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the object.
  Act: Invoke the getDescription() method on the object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned description is null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getDescription method returns the default value of the string (null) when not explicitly set. The significance of this test is to ensure that the description field is not initialized with any unexpected values at object creation.

Scenario 2: Test for set Description

Details:
  TestName: validateSetDescription.
  Description: This test ensures that the description field can be set correctly and retrieved using the getDescription() method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the object and set the description.
  Act: Invoke the getDescription() method on the object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned description matches the description set.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getDescription method returns the correct string that was set using the setDescription method. This is crucial for ensuring data integrity and proper functioning of the getDescription method.

Scenario 3: Test for Clearing Description

Details:
  TestName: validateClearingDescription.
  Description: The purpose of this test is to verify that once the description field is cleared or set to null, the getDescription() method returns null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the object, set the description and then clear it by setting null.
  Act: Invoke getDescription() method on the object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned description is null.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the getDescription method returns null after the description was cleared (set to null). It's important for ensuring the getDescription method accurately reflects the current state of the description field, even when it's changed after the initial setting.

Scenario 4: Test for Description of Empty String

Details:
  TestName: validateEmptyStringDescription.
  Description: This test will check the scenario when the description field is set to an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object instance and set the description as an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the getDescription() method on the object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned description is an empty string.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that setDescription can handle accepting an empty string and getDescription returns an empty string as expected. This is to ensure correct handling of edge cases in setting and getting description.
