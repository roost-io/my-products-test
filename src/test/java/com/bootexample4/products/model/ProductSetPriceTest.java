ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=setPrice_8f1e19b496

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Input parameter is not validated CWE-20
Issue: Method 'setPrice' accepts any double value without validation. This can lead to data inconsistency or incorrect behavior if negative or a large value is provided.
Solution: Encapsulate setting price logic in a more tightly controlled method, applying necessary validation rules, such as checking if the price is within a reasonable range.

================================================================================
"""
  Scenario 1: Test if setPrice correctly assigns values to price.

  Details:
    TestName: testSetPriceOnNormalValues.
    Description: The test aims to confirm if the setPrice method correctly assigns the inputted value to the price variable without errors.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define a price of type double.
    Act: Call the setPrice method with the defined price as a parameter.
    Assert: Assert that price is equal to the entered value.
  Validation:
    The setPrice method is working as intended, accurately assigning the price variable with the specified value. This is important for ensuring accurate pricing information is stored.

  Scenario 2: Test if setPrice can handle negative values.

  Details:
    TestName: testSetPriceOnNegativeValues.
    Description: The test is designed to check if the setPrice can successfully handle being executed with a negative number as a parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define a price of type double as a negative number.
    Act: Call the setPrice method with the defined price as a parameter.
    Assert: Assert that an exception is thrown.
  Validation:
    The setPrice method should not be able to accept negative values as these are unrealistic scenarios for a price - this would mean the customer is paid to buy a product. The test helps ensure the method has been appropriately designed to handle such incorrect inputs.

   Scenario 3: Test if setPrice can handle large values.

  Details:
    TestName: testSetPriceOnLargeValues.
    Description: The test is designed to check if the setPrice can successfully handle being executed with a very large number as a parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define a price of type double as a very large number.
    Act: Call the setPrice method with the defined price as a parameter.
    Assert: Assert that price is equal to the entered value.
  Validation:
    The setPrice method should be able to handle large values, as these might be realistic scenarios for a price, particularly in cases of expensive products. The test ensures the method can work with these large numbers.

  Scenario 4: Test if setPrice can handle zero value.

  Details:
    TestName: testSetPriceOnZero.
    Description: This test is to check if the setPrice can successfully handle being executed with zero as a parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define a price of type double as zero.
    Act: Call the setPrice method with the defined price as a parameter.
    Assert: Assert that price is equal to the entered value.
  Validation:
    The setPrice method should be able to accept zero values as these are realistic scenarios for a price, perhaps in cases of promotional events. This test helps ensure the method can work with zero values.
