================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Data Handling
Issue: The "setPrice" method doesn't validate the input parameter. Attackers could potentially exploit this by passing in unexpected values.
Solution: Add input validation in every setter method to ensure that only expected values can be assigned. For example, for a price it would make sense to check if the given value is not negative.

Vulnerability: Missing Entity Annotation
Issue: The class does not have the @Entity annotation, which might lead to issues if used with an ORM like Hibernate.
Solution: If this is an entity that should be stored in a database using Hibernate (or any other JPA provider), add the @Entity annotation on top of the class declaration.

Vulnerability: Possible Incomplete Object
Issue: Only a single method is provided. The class may not behave as expected if other important methods like its constructor(s) and other necessary setters/getters are missing.
Solution: Ensure that the necessary methods (constructor, setters/getters) for this class to properly function are not missing.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Check if the setPrice method sets a positive value properly.

Details:
  TestName: testSetPositivePrice.
  Description: This test checks if the setPrice method can set a positive price correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: None, as no preconditions are required.
    Act: Invoke the setPrice method with a positive double value.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the price variable has been set to the new positive value.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies if the setPrice method can successfully handle and set a positive price. The expected result is based on the normal application behavior of setting a price.


Scenario 2: Check if the setPrice method sets a negative value properly.

Details:
  TestName: testSetNegativePrice.
  Description: This test checks if the setPrice method can set a negative price correctly.
  Execution:
     Arrange: None, as no preconditions are required.
     Act: Invoke the setPrice method with a negative double value.
     Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the price variable has been set to the new negative value.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies if the setPrice method can successfully handle and set a negative price. The expected result is based on how the system should handle negative amounts as per business logic.


Scenario 3: Check if the setPrice method sets a zero value properly.

Details:
  TestName: testSetPriceToZero.
  Description: This test checks if the setPrice method can set a price to zero correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: None, as no preconditions are required.
    Act: Invoke the setPrice method with a double value of 0.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the price variable has been set to zero.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies if the setPrice method can successfully handle and set the price to zero. The expected result is based on how the system should handle zero amounts as per business logic.


Scenario 4: Check if the setPrice method handles very large values.

Details:
  TestName: testSetVeryLargePrice.
  Description: This test validates if the setPrice method can handle and set a very large price correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: None, as no preconditions are required.
    Act: Invoke the setPrice method with a very large double value.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the price variable has been set to that very large value.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies if the setPrice method can successfully handle and set a very large price. The expected result is based on the limit of double data type in Java and understanding the functionality of the application when handling large amounts.
