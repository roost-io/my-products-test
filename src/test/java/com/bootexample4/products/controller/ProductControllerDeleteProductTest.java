Based on the provided information and instructions, here are several test scenarios for the `deleteProduct` method in the `ProductController` class:

```
Scenario 1: Successfully Delete an Existing Product

Details:
  TestName: deleteExistingProduct
  Description: Verify that the method successfully deletes an existing product and returns a 200 OK response.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Mock ProductRepository
    - Create a sample Product with a known ID
    - Configure productRepository.findById() to return an Optional containing the sample Product
  Act:
    - Call deleteProduct() with the known ID
  Assert:
    - Verify that ResponseEntity.ok() is returned
    - Verify that productRepository.delete() was called with the correct Product
Validation:
  This test ensures that when a valid product ID is provided, the product is successfully deleted from the repository and the API returns a 200 OK response. It's crucial for maintaining data integrity and providing correct feedback to API consumers.

Scenario 2: Attempt to Delete a Non-existent Product

Details:
  TestName: deleteNonExistentProduct
  Description: Verify that the method returns a 404 Not Found response when attempting to delete a product that doesn't exist.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Mock ProductRepository
    - Configure productRepository.findById() to return an empty Optional
  Act:
    - Call deleteProduct() with a non-existent ID
  Assert:
    - Verify that ResponseEntity.notFound().build() is returned
    - Verify that productRepository.delete() was not called
Validation:
  This test confirms that the API correctly handles requests to delete non-existent products by returning a 404 Not Found response. It's important for maintaining consistent API behavior and preventing errors caused by attempting to delete non-existent resources.

Scenario 3: Handle Exception During Product Deletion

Details:
  TestName: handleExceptionDuringDeletion
  Description: Verify that the method properly handles exceptions that may occur during the deletion process.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Mock ProductRepository
    - Create a sample Product with a known ID
    - Configure productRepository.findById() to return an Optional containing the sample Product
    - Configure productRepository.delete() to throw a RuntimeException
  Act:
    - Call deleteProduct() with the known ID
  Assert:
    - Verify that an appropriate error response is returned (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error)
Validation:
  This test ensures that the API gracefully handles unexpected errors during the deletion process. It's crucial for maintaining system stability and providing meaningful feedback to clients in case of internal errors.

Scenario 4: Verify Idempotency of Delete Operation

Details:
  TestName: verifyIdempotencyOfDeleteOperation
  Description: Confirm that calling delete multiple times on the same product ID results in the same behavior.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Mock ProductRepository
    - Create a sample Product with a known ID
    - Configure productRepository.findById() to return an Optional containing the sample Product for the first call, and an empty Optional for subsequent calls
  Act:
    - Call deleteProduct() with the known ID twice
  Assert:
    - Verify that the first call returns ResponseEntity.ok()
    - Verify that the second call returns ResponseEntity.notFound().build()
    - Verify that productRepository.delete() was called only once
Validation:
  This test validates the idempotency of the delete operation, ensuring that repeated delete requests for the same product ID are handled consistently. This is important for maintaining data consistency in distributed systems where duplicate delete requests might occur.
```

These test scenarios cover the main functionality of the `deleteProduct` method, including successful deletion, handling of non-existent products, error handling, and idempotency. They use only the provided information and methods, without assuming the existence of any additional methods or fields.
