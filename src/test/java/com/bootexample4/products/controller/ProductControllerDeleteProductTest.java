Scenario 1: Successful Deletion of Product
Details:
  TestName: deleteProductSuccessfully
  Description: This test verifies that a product can be successfully deleted given a valid product ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product object and save it to the repository. Note its ID.
  Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with the Product's ID.
  Assert: Confirm that the repository does not contain the product.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the deleteProduct method successfully removes a product from the repository. This is important to ensure that the DELETE endpoint functions correctly.

Scenario 2: Deletion with Invalid ID
Details:
  TestName: deleteWithInvalidId
  Description: This test checks that attempting to delete a non-existing product results in the appropriate response.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose an ID that does not correspond to any stored product.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with the chosen ID.
  Assert: Confirm that the returned ResponseEntity has a status of 404 (Not Found).
Validation:
  This test validates that the system handles attempts to delete non-existing products gracefully, returning the correct HTTP status code. This is vital to the system's fault tolerance.

Scenario 3: Deletion of Already Deleted Product
Details:
  TestName: deleteProductTwice
  Description: This test ensures that deleting a product that has already been deleted results in the appropriate response.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a product object, save it to the repository, and then delete it. Note its ID.
  Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with the previously deleted Product's ID.
  Assert: Confirm that the returned ResponseEntity has a status of 404 (Not Found).
Validation:
  This test confirms that trying to delete an already deleted product is handled correctly. This is crucial for maintaining data consistency.

Scenario 4: Deletion with Null ID
Details:
  TestName: deleteWithNullId
  Description: The purpose of this test is to ensure that calling deleteProduct with a null ID results in a NullPointerException.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use null as product ID.
  Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with null as the parameter.
  Assert: Check whether a NullPointerException has been thrown.
Validation:
  This test validates that the function correctly handles null ID input, which is important as programmers might forget to check for null. Checking for null is mandatory to assure system stability.

/*
The unit test `deleteWithNullId()` is expected to throw a `NullPointerException` when the `deleteProduct()` method of the product controller is called with `null` as an argument according to the implemented business logic. However, the error log states that no exception was thrown.

The cause of this might be due to the way the `deleteProduct()` method is implemented. The method seems to handle `null` values when searching for the product in the repository as it uses `Optional` in `productRepository.findById(id)`. If no product with the given ID (in this case null) is found, `Optional`'s `orElse()` method will return a `ResponseEntity` with a `notFound` status, meaning 404. Due to this, instead of throwing a `NullPointerException` for `null` id, the method is returning a `ResponseEntity` with `notFound` status, which is catching and tightly handling the null case.

This is why the test `deleteWithNullId()` is failing. It expects a `NullPointerException` to be thrown when calling `deleteProduct(null)`, but the method under test is designed not to throw this exception due to the use of `Optional` and its `orElse` method.
@Test
@Tag("boundary")
public void deleteWithNullId() {
    Assertions.assertThrows(NullPointerException.class, () -> {
        productController.deleteProduct(null);
    });
}
