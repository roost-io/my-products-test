================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Use of GET or HEAD Request Method With Sensitive Query Strings
Issue: If this delete operation can be invoked via a GET request, then it can lead to a security concern. GET requests can be easily logged, cached or exposed via browser history.
Solution: Ensure that the sensitive operations like DELETE should not be performed via GET or HEAD HTTP Methods. Use appropriate HTTP method like DELETE. If this is REST API endpoint, then it should follow proper HTTP Verb semantics.

Vulnerability: CWE-352:Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Issue: If the API does not use CSRF tokens or alike, it can be forged via another website which may lead to unwanted deletion of data if the user is authenticated in browser.
Solution: Ensure that API has proper CSRF protection added. If it's Spring Boot Application, then CSRF protection can be easily added via Spring Security's CSRF Protection.

Vulnerability: CWE-639: Authorization Bypass
Issue: The code doesn't perform any authorization check if the authenticated user has the privilege to delete this product. It may allow any authenticated user to delete any product.
Solution: Always validate if the authenticated user has right privileges to perform the operation. If it's Spring Boot, then you could use Spring Security's Authorization features to validate the user's privileges.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful deletion of a product

Details:
    TestName: testSuccessfulDeletion
    Description: This test aims to confirm that the deleteProduct method works as expected when a valid id is provided. The method should successfully delete the specific product as represented by the Id.
  Execution:
    Arrange: A mock productRepository and a product with a valid Id.
    Act: Invoke deleteProduct method with the product Id.
    Assert: Assert that the returned response is ok (HTTP 200) after the product is deleted.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the product was successfully deleted and the application responded as expected. This is important to confirm that the delete functionality works correctly.

Scenario 2: Deletion attempt for a non-existent product

Details:
    TestName: testDeletionOfNonExistentProduct
    Description: This test is to verify the behavior of the code when the product to be deleted does not exist in the repository. The response should indicate that the product was not found.
  Execution:
    Arrange: A mock productRepository and an Id that does not correspond to any existing product.
    Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with the non-existent product's Id.
    Assert: Assert that the returned response is a not found (HTTP 404).
  Validation:
    The test validates that the method handles scenarios where the product to be deleted doesn't exist gracefully. This test verifies the application's robustness when facing erroneous input.

Scenario 3: Deletion attempt with a null ID

Details:
    TestName: testDeletionWithNullId
    Description: This test checks how the deleteProduct method behaves when a null Id is passed. Depending on the internal implementation of findById, an exception may be thrown that needs to be properly handled.
  Execution:
    Arrange: A mock productRepository.
    Act: Invoke deleteProduct method with a null Id.
    Assert: Confirm the correct exception is thrown (like IllegalArgumentException or NullPointerException).
  Validation:
    This test validates whether the deleteProduct method can handle null Id values. It makes sure the system fails safely under potential misuse or incorrect data.
