================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The provided Java code does not validate the ID input from the user. This could lead to unpredictable application behavior or exploitation like SQL Injection.
Solution: It is recommended to validate all input data from the user. In this instance, ensure the ID is valid before the findById() function is called.

Vulnerability: Missing Proper Error Handling
Issue: It appears that application errors during database operations are not properly handled and logged. This might lead to difficulty tracking down issues and potential information disclosure vulnerabilities.
Solution: Implement a proper error handling and logging mechanism that includes catching exceptions, logging errors to a file which the client doesn't have access to.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References
Issue: The code provides no mechanism to confirm if the authenticated user is authorized to delete the specific product record. This could lead to unauthorized users manipulating records they do not own.
Solution: Use Access Control Policies wherever needed. In this scenario, check if the current user has the appropriate permissions required to delete the product record.

"""
Scenario 1: Delete product with valid Id

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWithValidId
  Description: This scenario aims to validate that a product can be properly deleted when a valid Product ID is provided. It ensures proper execution of the getProduct method and its accuracy in returning a 200 OK response.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock a product and productRepository. Also, an ID for the product that exists within the mocked data can be setup.
  Act: Call deleteProduct with the ID of the existing product.
  Assert: Assert that the returned status is 200 OK.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that the status is 200 OK, indicating that the product was successfully deleted from the repository. It's crucial to ensure products are correctly removed when a valid ID is passed.

Scenario 2: Delete product with invalid/nonexistent Id

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWithInvalidId
  Description: This scenario aims to test the behavior of the deleteProduct method when given an ID that does not exist in the repository. It ensures the method returns a 404 NOT FOUND response in such circumstances.
Execution:
  Arrange: An ID for non-existing product needs to be setup. No other mocks or data setups are required for this test.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with the non-existing ID.
  Assert: Assert that the returned status is a 404 NOT FOUND.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that the returned response is a 404 NOT FOUND. This behavior is expected since the provided product ID does not exist in the repository, thus confirming the correctness of the method's error handling.

Scenario 3: Delete product when repository is empty

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWhenRepositoryIsEmpty
  Description: This test scenario checks the method's behavior when attempting to delete a product from an empty repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Setup should ensure that the repository is empty, without any products.
  Act: Call deleteProduct with any ID.
  Assert: Assert that the returned status is 404 NOT FOUND.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that the returned status when attempting to delete a product from an empty repository is 404 NOT FOUND. This confirms the method's correctness in handling scenarios where the repository is empty.
