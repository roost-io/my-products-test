1. Scenario: Delete Product with Valid ID
   Description: This scenario will test if the function is able to successfully delete a product when provided with a valid ID. 

2. Scenario: Delete Product with Invalid ID
   Description: This scenario will test how the function behaves when provided with an ID that does not exist in the product repository. The function is expected to return a not found response.

3. Scenario: Delete Product with Null ID
   Description: This scenario will test how the function behaves when provided with a null ID. This could help to test the function's robustness and error handling.

4. Scenario: Delete Product with Negative ID
   Description: This scenario will test how the function behaves when provided with a negative ID. This could help to test the function's robustness and error handling.

5. Scenario: Delete Product with Non-numeric ID
   Description: This scenario will test how the function behaves when provided with a non-numeric ID. This could help to test the function's robustness and error handling.

6. Scenario: Delete Product with ID of Product that was previously deleted
   Description: This scenario will test how the function behaves when provided with an ID of a product that was previously deleted. The function is expected to return a not found response.

7. Scenario: Delete Product when the repository is empty
   Description: This scenario will test how the function behaves when the product repository is empty. This could help to test the function's robustness and error handling.

8. Scenario: Delete Product when the repository is unavailable
   Description: This scenario will test how the function behaves when the product repository is unavailable or down. This could help to test the function's robustness and error handling.

9. Scenario: Delete Product concurrently
   Description: This scenario will test how the function behaves when multiple requests are sent to delete the same product concurrently. This could help to test the function's concurrency handling.

10. Scenario: Delete Product after adding new products
   Description: This scenario will test if the function is able to successfully delete a product when new products are added to the repository.
