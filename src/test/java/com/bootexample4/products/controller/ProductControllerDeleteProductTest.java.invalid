ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=deleteProduct_65c62d8b91

Scenario 1: Successful deletion of a product

Details:
TestName: deleteProductSuccessfully
Description: This test case is meant to check that the method successfully deletes a product that exists in the repository and returns a success response.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product with a specified ID and add it to the mock repository.
  Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with the ID of the created product.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity's status is OK (200), implying the product was successfully deleted.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that a product can be successfully deleted from the repository. This is important to ensure product data can be properly managed.

Scenario 2: Deleting a non-existent product

Details:
TestName: deleteNonExistentProduct
Description: This test case checks that the method correctly handles an attempt to delete a product that does not exist in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure the repository is empty or that no product with the specified ID exists.
  Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with the non-existent ID.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity's status is NotFound (404), indicating that the product was not found.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the method correctly handles attempts to delete non-existent products. This is key for maintaining data integrity and preventing errors.

Scenario 3: Deleting a product with a null ID

Details:
TestName: deleteProductWithNullId
Description: This test case is designed to check how the method handles an attempt to delete a product with a null ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as no product should have a null ID.
  Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with null as the ID parameter.
  Assert: Assert that an IllegalArgumentException or similar is thrown by the method.
Validation:
  This assertion confirms that the method handles null IDs robustly, adding to the application's overall resilience to erroneous inputs. 

Scenario 4: Repository behavior upon product deletion

Details:
TestName: checkRepositoryBehaviourUponDeletion
Description: This test case verifies if the method properly interacts with the repository when deleting a product (i.e., it instructs the repository to delete the product).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product with a specified ID and add it to the mock repository.
  Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with the ID of the created product.
  Assert: Assert that the method instructed the repository to delete the product of the specified ID.
Validation:  
  This assertion validates that the method rightly cooperates with the repository in deleting the product. This ensures that the app's components interact as expected.
