ROOST_METHOD_HASH=deleteProduct_032472106e
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=deleteProduct_65c62d8b91

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')
Issue: The current implementation of deleteProduct method does not validate the 'id' parameter in the @PathVariable annotation. This could be exploited by an attacker to redirect the user to an untrusted site.
Solution: Include server-side validation to ensure that the 'id' parameter is a valid Long and corresponds to an existing product in the database. This validation should be performed before any other operations.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: In the case of a non-existing product id, the application returns a generic 'not found' response. This could potentially expose sensitive information about the system or aid an attacker in understanding the application's structure.
Solution: Consider handling exceptions in a central place using @ControllerAdvice or @ExceptionHandler to avoid revealing system information. Also, ensure to return generic error messages.

Vulnerability: CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Issue: The code does not appear to have any CSRF protection. This could allow an attacker to trick a victim into making an unintended request to the web application.
Solution: Spring Security provides built-in CSRF protection that can be enabled in the SecurityConfig class. Also, ensure that the front-end code is properly handling CSRF tokens.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to delete a product that exists in the repository

Details:  
  TestName: deleteExistingProduct
  Description: This test is to check if a product that exists in the repository can be deleted successfully. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an existing product when findById is called. 
  Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with the id of the existing product.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity's status is OK.
Validation: 
  Verify that the product is deleted successfully. The expected result is HttpStatus.OK as the product exists in the repository and should be deleted successfully. This test is important to ensure that the delete functionality works as expected for valid products.

Scenario 2: Test to delete a product that does not exist in the repository

Details:  
  TestName: deleteNonExistingProduct
  Description: This test is to check if the appropriate response is returned when an attempt is made to delete a product that does not exist in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called. 
  Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with the id of a non-existing product.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity's status is NOT_FOUND.
Validation: 
  Verify that the correct response is returned when trying to delete a non-existing product. The expected result is HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND as the product does not exist in the repository. This test is important to ensure the application handles non-existing products correctly during deletion.

Scenario 3: Test to delete a product with a null id

Details:  
  TestName: deleteProductWithNullId
  Description: This test is to check if the appropriate response is returned when an attempt is made to delete a product with a null id.
Execution:
  Arrange: No need to mock anything as the id will be null.
  Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with a null id.
  Assert: Assert that an exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  Verify that an exception is thrown when trying to delete a product with a null id. The expected result is an exception as the id is null. This test is important to ensure the application handles null inputs correctly.
