================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')
Issue: In the current code, the ID from the URL is directly used to fetch the product. While this doesn't directly lead to an Open Redirect vulnerability, it's a pattern that can lead to such issues if a developer isn't careful. If any redirection based on the ID or any other user input is added in the future, it could be exploited to redirect users to malicious sites.
Solution: Always validate and sanitize user input. Be especially careful with any user input that is used in a URL or for redirection. If possible, use a list of allowed values instead of directly using user input in a URL or for redirection.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: If the product is not found, a 404 Not Found response is returned. While this is not directly an issue, if any more information is added to this error message in the future, it could expose sensitive information.
Solution: Always be careful with what information is included in error messages. Never include sensitive information in error messages. Instead, log the sensitive information server-side where it's not accessible to the user.

Vulnerability: CWE-384: Session Fixation
Issue: The current code does not handle sessions, but if it's added in the future, a common mistake is to not handle session fixation attacks. This can allow an attacker to hijack a user's session.
Solution: Always regenerate the session ID after login and after a certain time period. This prevents an attacker from using a fixed session ID to hijack a user's session.

Vulnerability: CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Issue: The current code does not handle CSRF protection. If any state-changing operations are added in the future, they could be vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
Solution: Use anti-CSRF tokens in all forms and AJAX requests that perform state-changing operations. This ensures that the request is only accepted if it includes the correct token, which is not known to an attacker.

"""
Scenario 1: Test getProductById with valid id
Details:
  TestName: testGetProductByIdWithValidId
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method can return the correct product when given a valid id.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock ProductRepository and mock a valid product id.
  Act: Invoke getProductById method with the mock id.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned product against the expected product.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the returned product matches the expected product. This is important to ensure that the getProductById method is functioning as expected and can retrieve the correct product using the given id.

Scenario 2: Test getProductById with invalid id
Details:
  TestName: testGetProductByIdWithInvalidId
  Description: This test is meant to check how the method handles a scenario where the provided id does not exist in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock ProductRepository and mock an invalid product id.
  Act: Invoke getProductById method with the mock id.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned response against a not found response.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method returns a not found response when the provided id does not exist in the repository. This is important for error handling and ensuring that the method behaves as expected when provided with an invalid id.

Scenario 3: Test getProductById with null id
Details:
  TestName: testGetProductByIdWithNullId
  Description: This test is meant to check how the method handles a scenario where the provided id is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock ProductRepository.
  Act: Invoke getProductById method with null id.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned response against a not found response.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method returns a not found response when the provided id is null. This is important for error handling and ensuring that the method behaves as expected when provided with a null id.
