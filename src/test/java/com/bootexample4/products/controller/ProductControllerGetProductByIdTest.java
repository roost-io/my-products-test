================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: Exposing product data just by knowing the ID carries the risk of data exposure by internal or external threat actors.
Solution: Implement an Access Control Layer (ACL) or another authorization method to verify whether the requester has the permission to view the requested data.

Vulnerability: CWE-384: Session Replay Attacks
Issue: If an unauthorized person intercepts the session, they could impersonate a legitimate user and gain access to the data.
Solution: Implement secure session management and use the secure flag for cookies in a HTTPS-only session to prevent session replay attacks.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: Assuming the 'id' is directly passed to a SQL query, your backend may be susceptible to SQL Injection attacks.
Solution: Even though the issue does not surface from the provided code, it's mentioned for completeness. Avoid direct user inputs in SQL queries. Keep using the ORM that handles these type of security issues.

Vulnerability: CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling
Issue: If getProductByID() function is incessantly invoked, it could potentially exhaust the server resources.
Solution: Implement request rate limiting on your server to prevent potential DOS attacks.

Vulnerability: CWE -307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts
Issue: If getProductById is a protected resource and the authentication mechanism allows unlimited failed attempts, a brute-force attack is possible.
Solution: Implement some kind of rate limiting or delay for consecutive failed login attempts.

"""
  Scenario 1: Validate getProductById with valid product id

  Details:
    TestName: getProductByIdWithValidId.
    Description: This test will verify if the method is able to fetch the product based on the valid id provided.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the ProductRepository to return a Product when findById is called with a valid id.
    Act: Call getProductById with a valid product id.
    Assert: The returned product matches the expected product.
  Validation:
    This test validates that the getProductById function correctly retrieves a product that exists in the repository.


  Scenario 2: Validate getProductById with null id

  Details:
    TestName: getProductByIdWithNullId.
    Description: This test will verify the method's reaction when null product id is provided.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is required.
    Act: Call getProductById with null.
    Assert: The method should throw IllegalArgumentException.
  Validation:
    This test validates that the getProductById function correctly handles a null id, which should not be a valid input.


  Scenario 3: Validate getProductById with non-existing product id

  Details:
    TestName: getProductByIdWithNonExistingId.
    Description: This test will verify if the method is able to handle the scenario when a non-existing id is provided.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the ProductRepository to return empty when findById is called with a non-existing id.
    Act: Call getProductById with a non-existing product id.
    Assert: The ResponseEntity returned should have a NOT_FOUND status code.
  Validation:
    This test validates that the getProductById function correctly returns an HTTP NOT_FOUND status when the product was not found in the repository.


  Scenario 4: Validate getProductById with an id corresponding to a deleted product

  Details:
    TestName: getProductByIdWithDeletedProductId.
    Description: In this test case, we would be checking if the method behaves as expected when provided with an id of a product that has been deleted.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the ProductRepository to return empty when findById is called with an id of a deleted product.
    Act: Call getProductById with a deleted product id.
    Assert: The ResponseEntity returned should have a NOT_FOUND status code.
  Validation:
    The test validates that when a user tries to request an item that has been deleted but had existed, the correct HTTP status code is returned.

// Suggested improvement in business logic:
