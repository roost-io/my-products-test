 * ================================VULNERABILITIES================================
 * Vulnerability: CWE-943: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a
 * Downstream Component Issue: In this code, the `Product` object is directly saved
 * without any validation or sanitation. This might lead to potential Injection attacks
 * such as SQL Injection or Cross Site Scripting (XSS) if the object fields are rendered
 * on the client side. Solution: Perform input validation such as length check, special
 * characters check or datatype check on the `Product` objectâ€™s fields before saving. Use
 * prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL Injection.
 *
 * Vulnerability: CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration Issue: There is no evidence of
 * session handling in the submitted code. If this method is part of a larger web
 * application with user sessions, missing session handling could lead to unauthorized
 * access. Solution: Ensure proper session management is implemented, including session
 * time outs, session invalidation after certain activities, rotation of session ids after
 * login, etc.
 *
 * Vulnerability: CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information Issue: The code
 * provided does not show any implementation of secure data transmission such as using
 * HTTPS. If sensitive data, including user credentials, are being sent over the network
 * without any encryption, it is susceptible to being intercepted by attackers. Solution:
 * Ensure that data transferred between client and server is encrypted preferably using
 * protocols like HTTPS.
 *
 * Vulnerability: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory
 * Issue: This code does not indicate any measures to prevent path traversal attacks. If
 * an attacker can control the input to filesystem operations, they can potentially access
 * or modify system files. Solution: You should validate user input by using a whitelist
 * to avoid path traversal vulnerabilities. Additionally, run your application with the
 * least possible privileges.
 *
 * ================================================================================ """
 * Scenario 1: Test Product created successfully
 *
 * Details: TestName: testProductCreatedSuccessfully Description: It verifies if the
 * application correctly creates and stores a single product entity into the database.
 * Execution: Arrange: Create a mock product entity. Act: Invoke the createProduct()
 * method with a mock product. Assert: Assert that the returned product is not null.
 * Validation: The assertion verifies that the returned product is not null, which shows
 * the product was created and stored successfully. This is vital for the application
 * since product creation is an essential feature and functionality of the product
 * management system.
 *
 * Scenario 2: Validate Product properties while creation
 *
 * Details: TestName: testProductPropertiesOnCreation Description: The test aims to
 * validate if the created product has all the desired properties defined correctly.
 * Execution: Arrange: Create a mock product entity with properties set. Act: Invoke the
 * createProduct() method with a mock product. Assert: Assert all the important properties
 * of the returned product match those of the mock product. Validation: This test ensures
 * that all the important properties of a created product are persisted correctly,
 * validating the data integrity plus the completeness of the saved product.
 *
 * Scenario 3: Validate Product Id generation on creation
 *
 * Details: TestName: testProductIdGenerationOnCreation Description: This test validates
 * if product Id is generated automatically once the product is saved. Execution: Arrange:
 * Create a mock product entity without an ID. Act: Invoke the createProduct() method with
 * a mock product. Assert: Assert that the returned product has a valid product Id.
 * Validation: This test ensures that product Id is auto-generated and assigned correctly
 * when a new product entity is created. This verifies that the product created can be
 * uniquely identified in the system.
 *
 * Scenario 4: Test Product creation throws exception for null input
 *
 * Details: TestName: testProductCreationThrowsExceptionForNullInput Description: This
 * test validates if createProduct method throws a suitable exception when invoked with
 * null. Execution: Arrange: No preparation is required. Act: Invoke the createProduct()
 * method with null. Assert: Assert that an exception has been thrown. Validation: This
 * test validates the robustness of the code by ensuring that the method can handle null
 * input gracefully. It confirms the system's behavior whenever a user tries to create a
 * product without providing any product information.
