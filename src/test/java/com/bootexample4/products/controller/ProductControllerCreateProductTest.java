================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-943: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic
Issue: The code does not validate or sanitize the input data before saving it to the database. This can lead to SQL injection attacks where an attacker can inject malicious SQL queries in the input data.
Solution: Use Prepared Statements or Parameterized Queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. Always validate and sanitize input data before using it in SQL queries.

Vulnerability: CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Issue: The application does not implement any CSRF protection mechanism. This can allow an attacker to trick a victim into making an unwanted request to the application which can lead to unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim.
Solution: Implement CSRF protection measures such as CSRF tokens in your application. Spring Security provides built-in support for CSRF protection.

Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
Issue: Without a limit on the size of the request, an attacker can send a large amount of data in the request body, causing the application to consume a large amount of resources and potentially leading to Denial of Service (DoS).
Solution: Implement a limit on the size of the request body to prevent resource exhaustion attacks.

Vulnerability: CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
Issue: The code does not implement any authentication or authorization checks before saving the product data. This can allow an unauthenticated user to create products.
Solution: Implement authentication and authorization checks before performing any critical functions. Spring Security provides built-in support for authentication and authorization.

"""
  Scenario 1: Test product creation with valid input data

  Details:
    TestName: testCreateProductWithValidInput
    Description: This test is meant to check the creation of a new product when valid product data is provided. It verifies that the product is saved successfully in the repository.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a valid Product object with all necessary fields filled.
    Act: Invoke the createProduct method with the created Product object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check whether the returned Product object is not null and its fields match the input.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the Product object returned from the method is not null, indicating successful product creation. It also checks that the returned product's fields match the input, ensuring that the product is saved correctly.

  Scenario 2: Test product creation with null input

  Details:
    TestName: testCreateProductWithNullInput
    Description: This test is intended to check the behavior of the createProduct method when a null value is passed as input. It verifies that the method handles null input appropriately without causing any errors.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement needed as the input is null.
    Act: Call the createProduct method with null as the parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned Product object is null.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the returned Product object is null, indicating that the method handles null input appropriately.

  Scenario 3: Test product creation with incomplete input data

  Details:
    TestName: testCreateProductWithIncompleteInput
    Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the createProduct method when the input Product object does not have all required fields filled. It verifies that the method handles incomplete input data appropriately.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Product object with some required fields missing.
    Act: Call the createProduct method with the incomplete Product object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned Product object is null.
  Validation:
    The assertion confirms that the returned Product object is null, indicating that the method handles incomplete input data appropriately.

  Scenario 4: Test product creation with duplicate input data

  Details:
    TestName: testCreateProductWithDuplicateInput
    Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the createProduct method when the input Product object has the same data as an existing product in the repository. It verifies that the method prevents the creation of duplicate products.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Product object with the same data as an existing product in the repository.
    Act: Call the createProduct method with the duplicate Product object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned Product object is null.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the returned Product object is null, indicating that the method prevents the creation of duplicate products.
