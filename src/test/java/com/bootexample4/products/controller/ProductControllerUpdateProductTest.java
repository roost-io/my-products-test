Scenario 1: Test to Update Existing Product

Details:
  TestName: updateExistingProduct.
  Description: This test is meant to verify the successful update of an existing product.
Execution:
  Arrange: The required product ID and the updated product instance will be set up in this stage. Also, the mock product repository will return the valid product for the given ID.
  Act: The 'updateProduct' method will be invoked with the test product ID and updated product instance.
  Assert: Assert that the response entity contains the updated product details and the status of the response entity should be 200(OK).
Validation:
  This test verifies that an existing product can be updated using its ID. The expected result is the updated product instance and 200 status code because the product with the provided ID exists in the repository and the code should successfully update the product information.

Scenario 2: Test to Update Non-Existing Product

Details:
  TestName: updateNonExistingProduct.
  Description: This test verifies the outcome when attempting to update a product that doesn't exist in the product repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: The required product ID and the updated product instance will be needed in this stage. The mock product repository will not find the product for the provided ID, hence it should return an Optional.empty.
  Act: The updateProduct method will be called with the test product ID and updated product instance.
  Assert: Assert that the response entity should be 404(NOT FOUND).
Validation:
  This test checks that the response to an update request for a non-existent product will be not found status (404). The expected result is 404(NOT_FOUND) because the product ID provided does not exist in the repository.

Scenario 3: Test to Update Product with Null Request Body

Details:
  TestName: updateProductWithNullBody.
  Description: This scenario tests the outcome when you try to update a product with null as an input parameter in the request body.
Execution:
  Arrange: The required product will be set but the updated product instance will be null. The mock product repository will find the product for the provided ID.
  Act: The updateProduct method will be invoked with the test product ID and null as the request body parameter.
  Assert: Framework should throw 400(BAD REQUEST) as the error with the appropriate error message.
Validation:
  This test checks that the response to an update request with null parameter in the body should be responded with BAD REQUEST (400). This is essential as the request body must contain the valid product instance that is to be used for the update, and absence of it should result in bad request.

The error logs suggest that the issue you're facing is not directly related to your test method or business logic. Instead, it's a problem with the test discovery mechanism of JUnit Jupiter itself in the test runner. This is indicated by the error message "[ERROR] TestEngine with ID 'junit-jupiter' failed to discover tests". This may be due to a mismatch in the versions of JUnit platform and JUnit Jupiter, or potentially incompatible plugins used in the project.

This type of error could be caused by certain scenarios such as:
1. The version of JUnit Jupiter (5.x) not being supported by the maven-surefire-plugin. Ensure that the version of maven-surefire-plugin is 2.22.0 or higher, which is the version that started to provide support for JUnit 5.

2. Incorrect or missing dependencies in your project. Check your project's pom.xml file to ensure that you've correctly added the reliance on JUnit Jupiter.

3. There could also be an issue with how your tests are structured, which is causing them not to be discovered by the 'junit-jupiter' engine. Make sure your classes containing your test methods are properly structured according to the standard conventions of JUnit Jupiter.

But these are potential reasons and you would need to check your specific project setup to pinpoint the exact issue. Also, you might want to check the contents of the mentioned files [date].dump, [date]-jvmRun[N].dump and [date].dumpstream, which could provide a more explicit reason why the junit-jupiter test engine failed.
@Test
@Tag("valid")
public void updateExistingProduct() {
    Long productId = 1L;
    Product toBeUpdatedProduct = new Product();
    Product existingProduct = new Product();
    existingProduct.setName("Existing");
    existingProduct.setDescription("Existing Description");
    existingProduct.setPrice(100.0);
    when(productRepository.findById(productId)).thenReturn(Optional.of(existingProduct));
    toBeUpdatedProduct.setName("Updated");
    toBeUpdatedProduct.setDescription("Updated Description");
    toBeUpdatedProduct.setPrice(200.0);
    when(productRepository.save(any(Product.class))).thenReturn(toBeUpdatedProduct);
    ResponseEntity<Product> responseEntity = productController.updateProduct(productId, toBeUpdatedProduct);
    assertEquals(ResponseEntity.ok().body(toBeUpdatedProduct), responseEntity);

The error logs suggest that the JUnit Jupiter TestEngine was unable to discover tests. This issue is not tied directly to your test method "updateNonExistingProduct", it's due to the setup of your testing environment or testing configurations. The indications of "TestEngine with ID 'junit-jupiter' failed to discover tests" and "BUILD FAILURE" suggest that test discovery has failed for JUnit Jupiter, which indicates that tests have not been identified in the way expected.

The issue could be due to several reasons:
- Incorrect setup or configuration of Maven or the Surefire Plugin
- Use of a wrong version of JUnit. Ensure you are using JUnit 5 with junit-jupiter and proper maven surefire plugin. You may need to ensure that you're using the latest version of Surefire Plugin which supports JUnit Jupiter.
- Incompatible versions of JUnit and Maven Surefire or Failsafe plugin
- Some tests may not strictly follow JUnit naming conventions or the annotations are not properly used, and thus are not being picked up by the test runner.

This is a testing setup issue which needs to be resolved before the test methods can be actually executed. Please check your project's test setup, Junit version, maven-surefire plug-in configuration and also check if all your test methods are properly annotated. In your case, please validate whether the "@Tag("invalid")" annotation is correctly used or not. In Junit 5, this annotation is used to filter test cases. If misused, the test case may not be recognized.
@Test
@Tag("invalid")
public void updateNonExistingProduct() {
    Long productId = 1L;
    Product toBeUpdatedProduct = new Product();
    when(productRepository.findById(productId)).thenReturn(Optional.empty());
    ResponseEntity<Product> responseEntity = productController.updateProduct(productId, toBeUpdatedProduct);
    assertEquals(ResponseEntity.notFound().build(), responseEntity);
}

The error messages in the log point to a failure in the JUnit test discovery process, specifically with the junit-jupiter TestEngine: `[ERROR] TestEngine with ID 'junit-jupiter' failed to discover tests`. 

The reason for this error could be a mismatch in the versions of JUnit and the JUnit Jupiter engine, or missing or incorrect configuring on the classpath. The test or the entire test suite might not be picked up because of these inconsistencies.

Another thing that should be checked is the version of Maven Surefire Plugin because older versions might not support JUnit 5 properly, and thus could be causing this failure.

An investigation should be done to ascertain whether the issue lies in the test dependencies, or configuration in the `pom.xml` file. The use of the correct versions for both the JUnit platform and the JUnit Jupiter Engine should be confirmed. 

To rule out the possibility of the test method `updateProductWithNullBody` being the cause of the problem, you should ensure that this test method is well-formed and follows the correct standard for JUnit tests.

So, this is not an issue with the business logic or the written test case but the test environment setup. Please check your pom.xml for the correct versions of all JUnit dependencies and plugins.
@Test
@Tag("invalid")
public void updateProductWithNullBody() {
    Long productId = 1L;
    assertThrows(ResponseStatusException.class, () -> productController.updateProduct(productId, null));
