"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if getAllProducts retrieves all items
TestName: shouldGetAllProducts
Description: This test is meant to check if the method getAllProducts successfully retrieves all the products in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list of products expected to be in the repository.
  Act: Invoke getAllProducts().
  Assert: Verify the returned list matches the expected list of products.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify if all the existing products are fetched from the repository. The expected result is the retrieval of all products as the method getAllProducts aims to fetch all the products. This test is significant to ensure that all the required products are being returned by the method.

Scenario 2: Test to check if getAllProducts handles the case where there are no products.
TestName: shouldHandleNoProducts
Description: This test is supposed to verify that the method getAllProducts handles the case where there are no products in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Make sure the repository has no products.
  Act: Invoke getAllProducts().
  Assert: Verify the returned list is empty.
Validation:
  The assertion is trying to verify whether the repository can handle a state when there are no products available in it and it does not throw an error. The expected result is an empty list to prevent the application from breaking when there are no entries in the product repository. This test is key in ensuring that the method can gracefully handle the condition of an empty repository.

Scenario 3: Test to validate the getAllProducts when new products are added to the repository.
TestName: shouldReflectNewProducts
Description: This test is designed to ensure that getAllProducts retrieves newly added items from the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Add new products to the repository.
  Act: Invoke getAllProducts().
  Assert: Verify that the returned list contains the newly added products.
Validation:
  The assertion is directed to ensure that the new products added to the repository are also considered by the method getAllProducts. The expected result is that all new products should be fetched by getAllProducts. This test is important in ensuring that the method continues to function accurately even when new items are added to the repository.

Scenario 4: Test to ensure getAllProducts function when a product is deleted from the repository.
TestName: shouldReflectDeletedProduct
Description: This test is meant to verify whether a deletion in the products from the repository is captured by the method getAllProducts.
Execution:
  Arrange: Delete a product from the repository.
  Act: Invoke getAllProducts().
  Assert: Verify the returned list does not contain the deleted product.
Validation:
  The assertion is aimed at verifying that the deleted product is not fetched from the repository. The expected result is that the deleted products should not be included in the fetch. This is important to ensure the repository is updated and accurately reflects the current list of products.
