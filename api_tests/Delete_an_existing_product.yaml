  - name: "Delete an existing product"

          expect:
            - statusCode: 200
            - hasProperty: productId
        # Here the test first checks that a product with ID 1 exists.
      - delete:
          url: "/products/{productId}"
          expect:
            - statusCode: 200

  - name: "Check if product still exists after deletion"
    flow:
      - get:
          url: "/products/{productId}"
          expect:
            - statusCode: 404
        # Here the test checks that the product with ID 1 no longer exists.

# The expected outcome is that the DELETE request returns a status code 200,
# indicating the product was deleted successfully.
# And that subsequent GET request returns a status code 404, indicating the product does not exist.
